Oulu University course project for TI SensorTag CC2650 
## What is this project about?
This project implements hand gesture detection for the SensorTag CC250.
The detection algorithm is based on acceleration sensor data which is compared against training data via cosine similarity.
Additionally, the project has a handful of other minor features related to the device (buttons, LCD, buzzer, LEDs).
